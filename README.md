## 1. What Is EPL?

The **Easy-Phenotyping Lab (EPL)** is a non-profit scientific initiativeâ€”just getting under wayâ€”to develop simple, novel, and reliable solutions for the widespread phenotyping challenges researchers in crop and plant sciences face globally. Building on the founderâ€™s published high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) research, EPL develops and shares low-cost software tools, code snippets, computational models, and novel measurement approaches designed to make plant and crop phenotyping accessible to any lab, anywhere. Consider this a global call for researchers in crop and plant phenotyping to share their tool achievements with peersâ€”particularly non-expert crop scientistsâ€”guided by EPLâ€™s principles of simplicity, availability, affordability, and reliability. Explore existing contributions today and help broaden access to phenotyping solutions worldwide.

## 2. Why Weâ€™re Here

- **Empower Research Worldwide:** Offer our easy-to-use, reliable, and low-cost phenotyping tools and methods to research labs globally, ensuring that simplicity and accessibility drive scientific discovery.  
- **Bridge Innovation and Adoption:** Invite phenotyping experts to adapt and share their latest solutions in formats that are readily available, affordable, and user-friendly for non-specialist researchers. By aligning diverse innovations with EPLâ€™s principles, we aim to close the gap between the multitude of annual technical advances and their practical uptake.  
- This approach addresses the current imbalance between the rapid pace of phenotyping tool development and its limited global utilization due to technical complexity and resource barriers.
