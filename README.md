## 1. What Is EPL?

The **Easy Phenotyping Lab (EPL)** is a non-profit scientific initiativeâ€”just getting under wayâ€”to develop and share simple, low-cost software tools, code snippets, and computational models for plant and crop phenotyping.  
Originating from published high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) research by the founder, EPL is an open invitation: explore whatâ€™s available now, and join a community focused on accessible, reproducible workflows.
